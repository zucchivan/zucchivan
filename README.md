## A _seasoned_ developer _(usually with some garlic and smoked paprika)_. 🍲

### Hello, Visitor! 👋

I'm Ivan, a Brazilian software gardener who is currently living in sunny Lisbon(🇵🇹). 

I had my first steps in programming by 2011, started coding professionally in 2014 and got my computer engineering degree by 2017. 

I'm not really sure how to write proper clever funny bios so I'm just gonna stick with the basic: 

- 🔭 Mainly working with: Java; Spring; Relational DBs; RedHat Openshift infrastructure;

- 📈 Most used programming languages: Java (by a lot), Kotlin, JavaScript & Python.

- 🌱 Currently learning: 
  * Getting the hang of WASM
  * GraalVM & Memory Safeness with JVM languages

- 📫 How to reach me: For professional reasons, preferably on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zucchivan/). For other purposes you can reach me out on Telegram (same username);

✨ So long & thanks for all the fish! ✨
