### Hello, Visitor! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan, Brazilian, graduated in computer engineering since 2017, professional software developer since 2014, currently located in Lisbon(ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹) and I'm not sure how to write proper clever funny bios so I'm just gonna stick with the basic: 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working with: Java; Spring; Relational Databases (mostly MySQL); Cloud infrastructure (a ton of AWS services); a little bit of Angular;

- ðŸ“ˆ Most used programming languages: Java, JavaScript & Python.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: 
  * Go
  * Getting the hang of WASM
  * Some blockchain networks paradigms & protocols (trying to figure if the whole web3 hype is real);

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: For professional reasons, preferably on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zucchivan/). For other purposes you can reach me out on Telegram (same user);
