## I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by. 🙃💨

### Hello, Visitor! 👋

I'm Ivan, a brazilian professional software developer since 2014, currently located in Lisbon(🇵🇹) and I'm not sure how to write proper clever funny bios so I'm just gonna stick with the basic: 

- 🔭 I’m currently working with: Java; Spring; Relational Databases (mostly Postgres); Application servers (JBoss EAP, Tomcat); Cloud (Azure);
Most used programming languages: Java, JavaScript & Python.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Rust and Go fundamentals / Blockchain networks paradigms & protocols (still trying to figure if the whole web3 hype is real);

- 📫 How to reach me: For professional reasons, preferably on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zucchivan/). For other purposes you can reach me out on Telegram (same user);

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him;

✨ So long, thanks for all the fish & happy coding! ✨
