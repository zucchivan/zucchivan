## I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by. ðŸ’¨

### Hello, Visitor! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan, a professional software developer since 2014, and I'm not sure how to proper write clever funny bios so I'm just gonna stick with the basic: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with: Java; Spring; Relational Databases (mostly Postgres); Application servers (JBoss EAP, Tomcat); Cloud (Azure);
Most used programming languages: Java, JavaScript & Python.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Rust and Go fundamentals / Blockchain networks paradigms & protocols (still trying to figure if the whole web3 hype is real);

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: For professional reasons, preferably on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zucchivan/). For other purposes you can reach me out on Telegram (same user);

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him;

âœ¨ So long, thanks for all the fish & happy coding! âœ¨
